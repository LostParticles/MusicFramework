There is a difference between midi message 

and midi event

midi message is sent to the device execute it

however to control the messages that is send we have to make some sort of time

this time is in the form of delta time

in midi file

each event contains  {delta time + midi message}
-------------

about midi event 0xFF  it is RESET  message   so that midi file reused this message to construct many
meta messages

my objective is to read the structure of the midi as it is using binary representaion.

note: all things are big endian (motorolla)

the class itself should hold its status code as attribute.

I think Status code should be separated of data because in case of running status we can  have multiple channel messages without changing in status

ok what about meta message {which is spreaded all over the track} ??!!

Status code as structure.

0xFF
